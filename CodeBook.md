# Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in `final_data.txt`.

# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

* First, all the similar data is merged using the `rbind()` function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
* Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from `features.txt`.
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from `activity_labels.txt` and they are substituted in the dataset.
* On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
* Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type . The output file is called `final_data.txt`, and uploaded to this repository.


## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
